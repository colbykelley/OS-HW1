# OS-HW1 (SHELL)
First this code asks the user to pick from the menu that it gives, using the numbers 1-6.
This code is basic implementations of the windows shell commands:
dir, used to make a new directory = (option 1).
cd, which prints the working directory = (option 2).
mkdir which creates a new one (also included rmdir which removes the directory). For this, it makes a new folder named "new_folder" then rmdir removes the folder named "old_folder." For this to work, it needs to already have a folder named "old_folder" within the directory = (option 3).
echo which displays the message, I just used Hello, World! for my code = (option 4).
type, that concatenates two text files, for this to work you need to have the txt files named "file1.txt" and "file2.txt," then this creates a new file that concatenates the two = (option 5).
and finally case 6 exits the program, I also included code for if the user did not input 1-6, which then couts that they need to pick a valid menu number and repeats the loop = (option 6).
